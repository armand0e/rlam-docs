## Downloading AudioKinetic Launcher
* Go to [www.audiokinetic.com](https://www.audiokinetic.com/) and login or signup.

    If you just signed up, you'll need to verify your email and
    wait for your account to be verified before being able to
    download anything from the site. Could take longer than
    other websites.

* Head to the [Downloads](https://www.audiokinetic.com/en/download) page and click the huge blue button that reads `Download AudioKinetic Launcher`-.
The version we need for RocketLeague is NOT under "Older Versions".

Install the AudioKinetic Launcher you just downloaded.
